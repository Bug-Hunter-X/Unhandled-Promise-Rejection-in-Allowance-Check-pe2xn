# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Allowance Check
This bug demonstrates an issue with unhandled promise rejections in a Dapp's allowance check.  The `checkAllowance` function uses promises but lacks proper error handling, causing failures to go unnoticed.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities in the application.

## Bug Description:
The provided Solidity code snippet attempts to check if the allowance of a token is sufficient.  However, if any error occurs during the allowance retrieval (e.g., network issues, contract issues), the promise rejection is not handled, leading to a silent failure. The Dapp might continue execution without realizing that the allowance check failed.

## Solution:
The solution involves adding a `.catch` block to handle potential errors during promise resolution.
